        <h2>About the Founder</h2> 
             <p>
            Ondrea was born in the early 90s. As a child, she used to play Platformer games as that was her favorite style of video game. Her favorite video game was Rayman 2, The Great Escape. She was intrigued by the visuals, style of gameplay, but mostly the music that accompanied it. The whole experience had her immersed for hours and it got her through hard times. Other games she enjoyed as a kid were Sonic, Tak and the Power of Juju, and Spyro for Gamecube; and Kirby and Pokemon for gameboy.

            Mostly a Nintendo girl, her interests carried over into adulthood, when Platformers were replaced by Shooters, which led her to become disinterested in gaming, but she never lost her interest in music. In her Mid 20s she started pursuing music by taking music production courses and creating music at home (See Samples). 
            </p>
            <p>
            Now that Platformers are making a comeback she can finally contribute to the genre with her unique style of mixing urban and house rhythms into her productions. She loves to intrigue the player's heart while they are on missions or on the battlefield.
